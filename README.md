# Fun With Toggle Button

This is a fun and romantic interactive web page designed to simulate a playful love proposal. It asks the user a simple question — *"Do you love me?"* — with “Yes” and “No” buttons. But there’s a twist! When the user tries to hover over the "No" button, the buttons **swap their labels** to ensure the answer is always "Yes"!

## Live Experience

When opened in the browser:

* A cute proposal message appears.
* Two buttons are shown: **Yes** and **No**.
* Hovering over “No” will **switch the buttons' text**, making “Yes” unavoidable.
* Clicking “Yes” triggers a heartwarming confirmation message:
  *“Congratulations, You Are Soulmates”*
* A smooth rotation animation is triggered to enhance the effect.
